"""Scheduled drift evaluation and alerting (LLD §46, gap analysis P1-12).

``GET /api/v1/drift`` already computes PSI and KS between two windows, but
only when somebody asks. Nobody asks at 3am, which is when a connector
changes its units or a station goes offline and the feature distribution
moves under a model that keeps answering confidently. This module is the
scheduled half: it sweeps every whitelisted signal on an interval, compares a
recent window against a reference window, and emits a structured alert for
anything that moved.

Two limits are stated rather than hidden, because both bound what a green
result here is worth:

* **This is distribution drift, not error drift.** It detects that inputs
  changed. It cannot detect that predictions became wrong while inputs stayed
  put, which needs delayed ground truth the system does not yet persist.
* **A moved distribution is not automatically a problem.** Winter genuinely
  looks different from monsoon. The alert says "this changed"; deciding
  whether that is seasonality or a broken feed is an operator's judgement,
  so the payload carries the numbers needed to make it.
