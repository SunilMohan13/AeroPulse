/**
 * The Demo / Live switch.
 *
 * `demo` serves the scripted narrative from `src/data/mock*.ts`: a curated
 * Punjab stubble-burning episode that transports into Delhi NCR. It is a
 * product feature, not a stub. It works with no backend, no token and no
 * network, which is exactly what a demo has to do.
 *
 * `live` calls the AeroPulse API. Without Timescale the API serves the same
 * Punjab replay episode the demo narrates, as contract-valid records. With
 * Timescale it shows whatever the worker has persisted. Models withheld by
 * the promotion gate stay labelled baselines.
 *
 * Why a module-level store rather than React state alone: the service layer
 * is plain async functions called from React Query `queryFn`s, and threading
 * a mode argument through every call site would touch every page for no
 * behavioural gain. The store is tiny, explicit and observable; the React
 * binding lives in `DataModeProvider`.
