"""Test-wide isolation from developer configuration.

``Settings`` loads a local ``.env`` (``SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")``).
That is right for running the platform and wrong for running its tests: a
developer who has configured real OpenAQ, FIRMS or Gemini credentials would
see different results from one who has not, and assertions about
"no credential is configured" would silently invert.

This pins the whole suite to declared defaults, so a test that wants a
credential sets one explicitly.
