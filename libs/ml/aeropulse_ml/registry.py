"""Filesystem-backed model registry with an explicit promotion lifecycle.

Implements the LLD §19 metadata set and stage machine without taking on MLflow
as a dependency. The interface is deliberately the shape MLflow exposes
(register, list, transition, resolve champion) so that swapping the backend
later does not touch calling code:

    TRAINING -> VALIDATION -> SHADOW -> CANARY -> PRODUCTION -> RETIRED

``artifact_uri`` is a local path today and an ``s3://`` key once MinIO
credentials are configured; callers must treat it as opaque.
