"""Trainers for the six AeroPulse models.

Estimator choice: scikit-learn's ``HistGradientBoosting*`` is used rather than
LightGBM (LLD §18.1). It is the same gradient-boosted-histogram family, but
scikit-learn ships its own OpenMP runtime in its wheels whereas LightGBM
requires a system ``libomp`` that is not present on every target machine. The
estimator is a single constructor call in each trainer, so swapping LightGBM
back in is a one-line change once that dependency is guaranteed.

Two leakage defects found in the notebook track are fixed structurally here:

* The anomaly baseline is fitted on **training rows only** and then applied to
  the test rows. Previously the baseline was computed over the whole dataset
  before splitting, so each test row's regression target had already seen the
  test period.
* The source-likelihood label is a weak rule over fire/pollutant/wind signals,
  and :data:`aeropulse_contracts.feature_spec.SOURCE_LIKELIHOOD` deliberately
  **excludes every input that rule uses**. Previously the classifier received
  the exact columns its own label was computed from, so a high score measured
  threshold re-derivation rather than source attribution.

Neither model is trained on validated ground truth. Both are weak-supervision
baselines and are reported as such; see ``docs/AeroPulse_ML_Architecture.md``.

# definitions (150 ug/m3 from the pm25 pipeline, 121 from the anomaly pipeline)
# collapse to one, at the CPCB "Very Poor" breakpoint of 121, so the product
# cannot show two contradictory hazard probabilities for one cell.
